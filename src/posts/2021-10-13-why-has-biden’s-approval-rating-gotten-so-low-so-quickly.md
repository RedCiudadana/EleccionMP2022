This has been true for a while now, too. Since Aug. 30, more Americans have disapproved of Biden than have approved of him. 

So, let’s tackle Biden’s declining approval rating in three parts. First, what do we know about why his approval rating has dipped? Second, how should we think about this current dip? That is, is it unusually large or actually pretty normal? And, finally, how much do presidents’ approval ratings matter, especially at this point in their presidency?

OK, first up, why has Biden’s approval rating dipped?

**alex** ([Alex Samuels](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/alex-samuels/), politics reporter): Given the timing, the two biggest things that have contributed to this decline appear to be Biden’s handling of [the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/bidens-approval-rating-on-handling-of-covid-and-economy-fall-in-latest-cnbc-all-america-survey.html) — specifically, how the situation has gotten worse due to the delta variant — and his administration’s [withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/02/1033433959/biden-approval-rating-afghanistan-withdrawal). 

I’d assume, though, that COVID-19 is likely to have a bigger impact on Biden in the long term because Afghanistan has largely faded from the news …

… and the pandemic affects so much more, including the economy — and Biden’s ratings on the economy were [never super-high to begin with](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-government-and-politics-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-only-on-ap-4dafe5b7a4adf2502280bb23b775af07). The delta variant itself, including its impact on people’s quality of life and on the economy — coupled with [fears of inflation](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/566297-poll-inflation-named-as-top-economic-concern-among-voters) — has hurt Biden’s standing.

**nrakich** ([Nathaniel Rakich](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/), senior elections analyst): Yeah, Alex, it’s clearly a range of factors. Biden’s approval rating [was already slipping](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-bidens-declining-approval-rating/) before Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, for instance, as the chart above shows.

I agree that the rise of the delta variant has likely played the biggest role, though. America went from [feeling like the pandemic was behind it](https://www.newsday.com/news/health/coronavirus/long-island-coronavirus-update-1.50285021) in early summer to experiencing the [second-highest caseload of the pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) by September. And Biden’s [approval and disapproval ratings on the coronavirus](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/) dipped from 62 percent and 33 percent, respectively, on July 1 to 49.6 percent and 42.0 percent today.

That said, I can’t shake the feeling that, if it hadn’t been for the delta variant or the coronavirus, something else would have caused a decline in Biden’s ratings. Presidents’ approval ratings [tend to dip in the summer of their first year](https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/cruel-summer) as the honeymoon period wears off and people start to notice the problems that are still around them.  

**geoffrey.skelley** ([Geoffrey Skelley](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/), elections analyst): Right, it’s possible that the situation in Afghanistan served as an inflection point. People who were already beginning to sour on Biden went ahead and said, “OK, that’s it.”

**nrakich:** Yeah, I agree with that, Geoffrey. The decline in his approval rating [really accelerated](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-declining-approval-rating-is-not-just-about-afghanistan/) after the fall of Kabul. My theory is that, for the first six months of Biden’s term, many Americans were enjoying the sense of calm that had fallen over the government after four tumultuous years under former President Donald Trump — and approved of Biden because, to them, he represented a more competent leader. But Afghanistan, and also the delta variant, shattered that calm and raised questions about whether Biden really was that competent after all.

**sarah:** There was also evidence that, prior to the delta variant’s peak, Biden’s approval rating had [already been dipping among independents](https://morningconsult.com/2021/08/04/biden-approval-independents-covid-economy/), so it certainly seems as if there’s no one answer for why Biden’s numbers have dropped.

How big a deal is this slump, though? For over a month now, more Americans have disapproved of Biden than have approved of him. Is that unusual at this point in a president’s term?

**nrakich:** Looking at the past several decades, it’s unusual. Only two other presidents since 1945 have had net negative approval ratings at this point in their terms: Gerald Ford (-9.1 points) and Trump (-18.2 points), and only one other president was below water at any point in his first 265 days (Bill Clinton).

That said, I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect Biden to match the average approval rating of presidents at this point in their terms, which is 61 percent. American politics is more polarized now than at any other point in the past 80 years, so recent presidents have tended to have approval ratings closer to 50-50 at this point. In that sense, Biden should be graded on somewhat of a curve — but even then, he’s still doing worse than former President Barack Obama (+12.1 points) on Oct. 11, 2009.

**alex:** Yeah, everyone expected Biden’s approval rating to drop at some point because every president except for Trump has benefited from a honeymoon period of above-average approval ratings when they first assumed the presidency. Those honeymoon periods invariably end.

But certain things like the COVID-19 pandemic, immigration and Afghanistan probably accelerated the disapproval numbers we’re seeing now.

**geoffrey.skelley:** For what it’s worth, though, Biden also started out at a lower number to begin with, undoubtedly in part because of how polarized our political environment is, as Nathaniel said. Biden has had [an approval rating above 90 percent among Democrats](https://news.gallup.com/poll/329384/presidential-approval-ratings-joe-biden.aspx), but his approval among Republicans has been, at best, around 20 percent [in some polls](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bidens-approval-rating-has-barely-budged-in-his-first-6-months/), and more like 10 percent in others.

That polarization obviously also contributed to Trump’s circumstances. And because of it, some of the comparisons to presidents further back in time are harder to make. Nowadays, [many Americans no longer tend](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-should-we-expect-of-bidens-approval-rating-in-the-first-few-months/) to give a new president from the other party some early benefit of the doubt. For instance, John F. Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower both started their presidencies with approval ratings around 70 percent or higher. That’s not happening again anytime soon.

**nrakich:** Right, I think the days of a president getting a 70 percent approval rating right out of the gate are clearly over. But we saw early on that Biden still had very low disapproval ratings — as low as 34 percent at one point. So, I think some people — specifically, Trump voters — were giving Biden the benefit of the doubt. But they eventually returned to their partisan corners. You can see how Biden’s disapproval rating has inched up for basically his whole term, though the rate of increase accelerated in August.

**sarah:** On that note, we’ve found that presidents’ approval ratings [tend to revert to the mean](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/), and at least since Obama, these ratings have been pretty steady, moving within a fairly narrow band. Can the same be said of Biden at this point? Or is it a big deal that his approval rating has dipped by as much as it has for as long as it has? 

**alex:** It’s definitely something his administration (and all Democrats) will have to account for, especially as we get closer to next year’s midterm elections. I’d imagine that most Democrats seeking office right now are wondering this: “How do I engage my base without having an obvious bogeyman (Trump) to point to or a popular standard-bearer (Biden) to hitch my star to?” And what legislative victories will they be able to point to next year? 

And this probably puts more pressure on the Biden administration to figure things out with [the infrastructure and reconciliation bills](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/wall-street-says-to-prep-for-infrastructure-and-budget-reconciliations-bills.html). I’m skeptical that passing either bill will significantly change Democrats’ [overall midterm outlook](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-2022-be-a-good-year-for-republicans-yes-we-know-its-early/), but doing so could shore up some enthusiasm among his base — which Biden [could certainly use right now](https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/21/voter-enthusiasm-midterms-polling/).

**geoffrey.skelley:** Biden’s approval has actually been pretty steady compared with that of past presidents in their early days. If you look at the middle-50 percent range of daily average approval ratings in FiveThirtyEight’s approval data for presidents in their first nine or so months, Biden and Trump have seen the least variation of any of them, with less than a 4 percentage point difference between the high and low ends of that middle-50 percent. More broadly, Biden’s approval rating has dropped as low as 44 percent, but even then, the range between his highest and lowest marks is only 11 points — the same went for Trump — while Obama and Clinton had differences of 17 and 24 points, respectively. (George W. Bush’s approval skyrocketed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, making him a less useful comparison.)

**sarah:** Do we have a sense of how strong some of this opposition to Biden now is? The Cook Political Report’s Amy Walter had [written earlier in September](https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/intensity-opposition-biden-rises-solid-support-drops-august) that not only was Biden struggling with more Americans disapproving of the job he was doing as president, but more Americans were *strongly* disapproving of it. Is this still the case? What does that mean if some of the opposition is so baked in?

**nrakich:** Yes. Just as with Trump, the vast majority of those who dislike Biden do so with a passion. In an average of polls conducted entirely in October so far, 42 percent of respondents *strongly* disapproved of his job performance, while only 10 percent *somewhat* disapproved. And his strong disapproval numbers are on the rise. Back in May, his average strong disapproval rating was only 32 percent, while his average somewhat disapproval rating was still 10 percent.

(Of course, it’s probably that some people went from approving of Biden to somewhat disapproving of him, and others went from somewhat disapproving of him to strongly disapproving of him. But regardless, it’s not a good trend for him.)
